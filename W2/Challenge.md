Premise
You’ve been asked to ensure that the Preventice branding is applied consistently and ubiquitously across all Preventice software projects. Marketing has helpfully provided precise logo requirements. This normally would be a fairly simple task, but your latest project is a console-only application and you’re unable to use this image directly. But you’re an programming wiz, I’m sure you can whip up a solution in no time!

Challenge
Write a C# program that faithfully reproduces the above “Preventice Solutions” logo along with the “Radio ‘P’” by printing to the console window (a.k.a. standard out).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Judging
You have until 6:00pm on Thursday the 2nd to submit your answer to me. I will compile and run the code and review the output; if the logo is not recognizable it will be rejected. Submissions should be in the form of a single .cs code file and instructions for how to compile and run it, if necessary.

The submission’s score will be calculated as the total byte length of the .cs file. If you use any library outside of the standard .NET framework (e.g. a NuGet package), the total byte length of that library’s source code will be added to the submission’s score. If the also output faithfully reproduces the color of the logo, the submission’s score will be reduced by 20%. If the submission uses ASCII art and avoids simply printing the letters “Preventice” or “Solutions” (or some variation thereof), the submission’s score will be reduced by 20%.

The submission with the lowest total score will be deemed the winner. The winner will receive a prize on Friday the 3rd.
